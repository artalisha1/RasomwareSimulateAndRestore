# Restic Ransomware Simulation & Autoâ€‘Recovery Lab 

This notebook (SimulateRansom+Restore_Periodic.ipynb) integrates **ransomware resilience** with Restic.
It mounts persistent storage, autoâ€‘snapshots live data, simulates an AESâ€‘encrypted attack, and then restores the latest clean baselineâ€”verifying that critical files remain intact.

## Project Overview

Pipeline stages executed in the notebook:

1. **Persist to Drive** â€“ keeps your lab alive across Colab VM resets.
2. **Install Restic & deps** â€“ gets all required CLI tools.
3. **Configure repo & paths** â€“ initializes Restic repository and helper utilities.
4. **Generate sample data** â€“ creates docs, images & log streams.
5. **Realâ€‘time autoâ€‘snapshots** â€“ watchdog takes a snapshot each time a file closes.
6. **Periodic baselines** â€“ scheduler reâ€‘tags the latest state every 30â€¯s.
7. **Simulate ransomware** â€“ encrypts docs, tags `attack` snapshot.
8. **Automatic clean restore** â€“ locates latest good baseline, restores and swaps.
9. **Validation & cleanup** â€“ verifies integrity, compares trees, and stops background threads.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum Version |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **GoogleÂ Colab** | any |
| **Python** | 3.9+ |
| **Restic CLI** | 0.12+ |

## Notebook Workflow Stepâ€‘byâ€‘Step

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| ** 0** | Mounts GoogleÂ Drive and sets a persistent `ROOT` directory. |
| ** 1** | Installs Restic, GnuPG, and tree via `apt`. |
| ** 2** | Initializes or opens the Restic repository and defines utility functions. |
| ** 3** | Creates sample `victim_data` hierarchy (docs, images, rolling logs). |
| ** 4** | Defines `print_snapshots()` helper to list Restic snapshots filtered by tags. |
| ** 5** | Implements `ensure_baseline_snapshot()` to capture the first **baseline** snapshot. |
| ** 6** | Starts a `watchdog` event handler that runs `restic backup --tag auto` on every file close. |
| ** 7** | Launches a background thread that writes a new log file every 15â€¯s to simulate workload. |
| ** 8** | Creates `start_periodic_baseline(interval=30)` to retag the latest state as **baseline** every 30â€¯s. |
| ** 9** | Defines `restore_latest_clean_baseline()` which iterates baseline snapshots, restores to a temp dir, and verifies key files. |
| **10** | Sleeps ~30â€¯s so producer & watchdog can create auto snapshots. |
| **11** | Encrypts docs with OpenSSL AESâ€‘256 and tags the snapshot as **attack**. |
| **12** | Attempts to view encrypted filesâ€”demonstrating access failure. |
| **13** | Runs the restore helper to recover the latest clean baseline. |
| **14** | Verifies that restored files (e.g., `report_Q1.txt`) match expected plaintext. |
| **15** | Performs a sanity `diff` between original and restored directories. |
| **16** | Signals producer and watchdog threads to stop and joins them. |

## Customization Tips

* **Change intervals** â€“ adjust `producer()` and `start_periodic_baseline()` for different RPO/RTO goals.
* **Add critical files** â€“ extend integrity checks inside `restore_latest_clean_baseline()`.
* **Swap encryption payload** â€“ test other ransomware samples in an isolated lab.
* **Offâ€‘host backups** â€“ point `RESTIC_REPO` to S3, MinIO, or Azure for cloud recovery drills.

## Next Steps

* Export metrics to **Prometheus** for snapshot latency and failures.
* Integrate with **CI/CD** to automatically run attack/restore scenarios and assert SLOs.
* Use **systemd timers** or **cron** for onâ€‘prem instead of Colab threads.
* Compare **Restic dedup stats** under different backup strategies.
